About
===================
This website is a final year project by Vytas and Finn visualizes data taken from The main object of the project was to learn and utilize data visualization techniques with javascript and the d3.js library.

Data visualizations are most useful with large amounts of data that may seem overwhelming represented in other ways, so we decided on using census data, in the form of json files, from the Central Statistics Office(CSO).

One of the most striking statistics from the CSO is the population change recorded from famine times onwards. With some counties losing over 70% of their population to starvation/emigration. We tried and convey this data by pairing the shrinking, and in some cases growing, population with the sizes of the counties themselves.

In addition we made a representation of some more recent data about the irish economy from 2000-2012 using colour rather than size.
